ðŸš€ Exploring Smol Agent Capabilities with Web Interaction and Managed Agents ðŸš€

This script demonstrates how to leverage Smol Agent tools to perform advanced tasks like visiting webpages, 
fetching and converting webpage content to markdown, running web searches, and managing agents for dynamic workflows.

Key Highlights of My Implementation:
1. **Webpage Interaction**:
   - Used `visit_webpage` to fetch webpage content and convert it to markdown format, removing extra line breaks for cleaner output.
   - Example Use: Querying real-time data or extracting readable content from any webpage.

2. **Managed Agents for Web Search**:
   - Integrated `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` with `ToolCallingAgent` to perform live web queries.
   - Example Use: Running searches for future trends like AI developments in 2025.

3. **Dynamic Multi-Agent Management**:
   - Configured `ManagedAgent` to orchestrate multiple agents for seamless task execution.
   - Example Use: Enabling complex workflows with additional imports like NumPy and Pandas for advanced data processing.
